<hr />
<p>I'm a software engineer and architect with a wide technical breadth and deep understanding of many systems. My background has led me to cloud-based SAAS application architecture, design, and scalability. I have high attention to detail, excellent verbal and written skills, and am driven to produce robust, high-quality, user-friendly software. For the past 15+ years, my primary programming language and ecosystem has been Python. However, I enjoy and am capable of jumping into different languages and ecosystems.</p>
<p>I have been working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently since 2009. My recent focus has been cloud architecture on AWS using microservices, containers and the vast array of AWS services.</p>
