I'm a software engineer and architect with a wide technical breadth and deep understanding of many
systems.  My background has led me to cloud-based SAAS application architecture, design and
scalability. I have strong attention to detail, excellent verbal and written skills, and am driven
to produce powerful, high quality, user-friendly software. For the past 15 years my primary
programming language and ecosystem has been Python, however I enjoy and am capable of jumping into
different languages and systems.

\

My recent focus is building microservices with Docker on top of Amazon Web Services.
